# An RRG Parser for Middle Constructions in Faroese

This repository contains a document describing a parser for middle constructions in Faroese, some Python code implementing the parser using NLTK, and a file containing a feature based grammar used with NLTK parsing functions.

The requirements for running the parser are Python 3 with NLTK installed. The sentences you want it to parse can be given in a text file called `sentences.txt`.
